ScrollReveal is a JavaScript library for easily animating elements as they enter/leave the viewport. It was designed to be robust and flexible, but hopefully youâ€™ll be surprised below at how easy it is to pick up.

## Splitting JS
https://splitting.js.org

Splitting is a JavaScript microlibrary with a collection of small built-in plugins designed to split (section off) an element in a variety of ways, such as words, characters, child nodes, and more!

The Splitting library does not handle any animation, but it gives you the elements and tools needed to create animations & transitions with JavaScript animation libraries or only CSS!. Most plugins utilize a series of <span>s populated with CSS variables and data attributes that empower you to build all kinds of animations, transitions and interactions.
